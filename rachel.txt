HEY!!!
I haven't seen you around these parts before, you must be new here!
..Where are you? Oh, nobody told you?? Welcome to EXCELsior! This is the place that people go when they're just a liiiiittle too excited about a good Excel macro...
and have spent a liiiiiittle too long without talking to any REAL women.
In any case... it's nice to meet you! My name's Rachel. I'm, like, the only NORMAL person in here.
Just between me and you, I'd keep an eye out. The girls here in EXCELsior... well, let's just say that they wound up here for the same reason you did. They might just take a reeeeal liking to a guy like you.
...
Why? Well...They're NERDS! JUST LIKE YOU!
Listen. If you can charm these girls by showing your skills and saying the right things, you might just prove that you have the social skills to get out of this place!!
From your looks, you're off to a rough start. I'd say you have... hmmmmmm...
five charisma points?
You'll need at least 20 to get out of here. It's a tall order... but I think you can do it! Good luck, and go talk to some girls!
